## Intro

Disclaimer: This is not my idea alone. I have set this up across the years and in multiple companies with the help of key people in my teams. A few of these people have been instrumental in making this a success:

- [@paraxial](https://github.com/paraxial)
- [@tomdalling](https://github.com/tomdalling)
- [@he-wowers](https://github.com/he-wowers) - He was Firewarden far too long, we actually ended up calling the role, "The Will" 

### What

We will assign a Firewarden every week. This person will be working full time on BAU, including support tickets. This means that in a team 3 people, there will be 3 different Firewardens and each Firewarden will only be working on BAU once every 3 weeks. As the number of team members grow, this frequency will also change - ie in a team of 10, one only gets to be a Firewarden once every 10 weeks.

### Why do we need a Firewarden?

Having a Firewarden means we address BAU, support issues, etc while also being able to work on feature work and improvements. This also means that the rest of the team are shielded from the noise of context switching from working on a feature vs someone randomly asking them for a report or to generate data etc.

### What does a Firewarden do?

Here are the list of responsibilities of the Firewarden:

- works with Support escalation tickets
    - additionally, documents each ticket done and HOW TO FIX it in Confluence if not yet documented
- works with Tech debt cards (prioritised beforehand by the team/tech lead)
- works with urgent bugs found in production
- can run reports asked by different parts of the business
- will be looking at monitoring/observability dashboards and see areas of improvement/problems
    - if there is a blind spot, create a card and prioritise later/immediately work on it
- runs point in emergency/major incidents
    - additionally, will be the one writing the PIR for the incident

### That seems a lot! Will they need help?

Definitely! A Firewarden does NOT have to tackle fires alone - they can definitely ask for help - bearing in mind that one of the reasons for having a Firewarden is to shield others from being distracted by all these. That said, it shouldn’t be a deterrent to ask for help.

### What if the Firewarden is sick?

We have a primary and secondary Firewarden. The primary is the one whose full time job is to “put out fires”. After the week of Firewarden work, the next person on the roster will be the primary and the previous Firewarden will be the secondary - this is to maintain any context from ongoing cards/tasks/etc.

### Advantages

- Only 1 (or 2) point person for support to contact at a time
- They have access to this person for the whole week and this person’s attention is solely on support/BAU work
- Makes sure that our support/BAU work will always be prioritised properly
- Knowledge sharing - not all will be able to solve issues, so they will ask for help
- This shields all the other team members from context switching and there is only one accountable person at a time - having everyone accountable is akin to having no one accountable


### Disadvantages

- Sometimes the Firewarden can get overwhelmed by too many issues - they will need to ask for help from the secondary Firewarden
- Managing the calendar will be another thing to do - but this should be isolated to tech leads/EMs
- Not all Firewardens have the same skill level and knowledge - this can possibly disrupt others still
    - this is expected at the start - as we build our own Firewarden playbook/knowledge base, this will be less of a problem
